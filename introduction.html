            <h3>Disentangled Representation Learning for Real-world Applications (DRL for Real)</h3>
            
            <div class="intro-content">
                <p>Disentangled Representation Learning (DRL) is considered one of the possible ways for AI to fundamentally understand the world. It has the potential to help alleviate hallucination problems in large language models/multimodal large language models and controllability issues in generative models, ultimately leading to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Over the years, disentangled representation learning has gained significant academic interest and research contributions, as it is believed to improve model robustness, interpretability, and generalization capabilities.</p>
                
                <p>However, the field currently faces a significant gap: the lack of comprehensive, realistic benchmarks and unified evaluation metrics that reflect real-world characteristics, which keeps DRL confined to synthetic toy scenarios and difficult to apply to more practical applications. To bridge this gap, this "DRL for Real" workshop aims to strengthen the development of DRL research towards practicality and real-world applicability.</p>
                
                <p>The core objective of this workshop is to make disentangled representation learning truly useful and practically relevant. Specifically, we will introduce novel, realistic datasets and comprehensive benchmarks aimed at better evaluating DRL methods in practical scenarios. In addition, the workshop will also discuss specific applications of DRL in key areas such as controllable generation and autonomous driving. The list of related topics includes:</p>
