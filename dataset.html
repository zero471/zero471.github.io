            <div class="dataset-description">
                <p>To bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical applications in disentangled representation learning, we will introduce a series of novel, realistic datasets that reflect the complexity and diversity of the real world. These datasets will contain multiple modalities, multiple attributes, and complex interrelationships, providing more challenging benchmarks for research in disentangled representation learning.</p>
                
                <p>Our datasets will cover the following key areas:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Multi-attribute Image Dataset</strong>: Contains images with multiple controllable attributes such as shape, color, texture, pose, etc., with complex interrelationships between these attributes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Temporal Dataset</strong>: Contains data that changes over time, used to evaluate the ability of disentangled representation learning to capture temporal dynamics and causal relationships.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cross-domain Dataset</strong>: Contains data from different domains, used to evaluate the ability of disentangled representation learning in cross-domain generalization.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Participants can use our provided datasets, or other public or private datasets, as long as they provide detailed data descriptions when submitting. We encourage participants to explore the potential of disentangled representation learning in various practical application scenarios.</p>

                    <p><strong>Multi-attribute Image Example</strong></p>
                    <p>This dataset contains images with multiple controllable attributes such as shape, color, texture, pose, etc. The goal of disentangled representation learning is to learn to decouple these attributes into independent representations, allowing each attribute to be controlled individually without affecting others.</p>

                    <p><strong>Temporal Data Example</strong></p>
                    <p>This dataset contains data that changes over time, used to evaluate the ability of disentangled representation learning to capture temporal dynamics and causal relationships. By learning disentangled representations along the temporal dimension, models can better understand and predict the behavior of complex systems.</p>
