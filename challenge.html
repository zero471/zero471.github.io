                    <h3>Competition Overview</h3>
                    <div class="challenge-description">
                        <p>To further promote the practical utility and controllable generation applicability of Disentangled Representation Learning (DRL), we organize a competition as part of the workshop. The primary goal of this competition is to promote the development and evaluation of DRL methods on realistic datasets, thereby accelerating the transition of disentangled models from theoretical research to practical applications.</p>
                        
                        <p>Our competition is divided into two main categories:</p>
                        
                        <h4>1. Single-Factor Challenge</h4>
                        <p>This track provides a large number of images with corresponding text descriptions. Participants will be evaluated using disentanglement metrics such as DCI (Disentanglement, Completeness, and Informativeness) to assess the quality of learned representations.</p>
                        
                        <h4>2. Multi-Factor Challenge</h4>
                        <p>This track is further divided into two sub-tracks:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>General Image Dataset Track:</strong> Focusing on everyday scenarios with multiple disentanglement factors.</li>
                            <li><strong>Autonomous Driving Dataset Track:</strong> Specifically designed for autonomous driving scenarios with various environmental factors.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>Each sub-track has two leaderboards:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Overall Leaderboard:</strong> All methods are evaluated and ranked here.</li>
                            <li><strong>Disentanglement Leaderboard:</strong> Only disentanglement models are evaluated and ranked here.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>Disentanglement models will be evaluated on both leaderboards, while other methods will only be evaluated on the overall leaderboard.</p>
                        
                        <p>The top three winners from each leaderboard will be invited to attend the ICCV conference in person to share their approaches and insights.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>By training and evaluating models on controllable generation data, our aim is to foster meaningful advancements in the DRL community and facilitate its integration into practical scenarios.</p>
